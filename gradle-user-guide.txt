Every Gradle build is made up of one or more projects.
Each project is made up of one or more tasks. A task represents some atomic piece of work which a build performs. This might be compiling some classes, creating a JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some archives to a repository.

运行build.gradle中的XXX task. >gradle -q XXX
gradle中的tasks等同于Ant中的targets.


task hello {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello world!'
    }
}
上述的task可以简单地定义成以下的task:
task hello << {
    println 'Hello world!'
}
The << operator is simply an alias for doLast.
